# Lost and Found Reporting Platform
## Description of Our Idea

We have built a platform where anyone with access to the internet can register for a Missing person's report.
## Solution

Our platform releases the fetching rate of a person. With data being on public system it's easier and faster for recognition of missing person by general public.
## Description of the Technology :

We have used PHP as our base language to design most components. We haved deployed the application over cloud platform.
